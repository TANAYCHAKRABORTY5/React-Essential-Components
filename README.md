It has all the important interview questions asked to web developer . I have been working on it  and will update the file as i create more.

list of all the comonents :-

1)Accordion - An accordion is a user interface (UI) pattern often used in web design to present content in a collapsible and expandable manner. 
              It consists of a series of panels, each containing content such as text, images, or other UI elements. By default, only one panel 
              is typically expanded at a time, and clicking on a panel's header collapses the currently expanded panel (if any) and expands the clicked panel.
              Accordion panels usually have a header section that indicates the title or summary of the content within the panel. Clicking on the header toggles 
              the visibility of the content inside the panel.

2)Random-color - A "React random color generator task" is a programming exercise or assignment that involves creating a React component that generates 
                 random colors. The task typically requires  to implement a React component that can produce random colors and display them in the UI.
